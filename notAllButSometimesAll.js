// Write a function that takes in a string and an object/hash/dict/Dictionary.

// The keys of the dictionary indicate which characters to remove, and the value associated to a key specifies how many instances of this character to remove, in order of appearance in the string from left to right.

// Return the filtered string.

// Examples
// // remove from 'this is a string' the first 1 't' and the first 2 i's.
// "this is a string", {'t':1, 'i':2} ==> "hs s a string"

// // there are no x's or i's, so nothing gets removed
// "hello world", {'x':5, 'i':2} ==> "hello world"

// // we don't have 50 a's, so just remove it till we hit end of string.
// "apples and bananas", {'a':50, 'n':1} ==> "pples d bnns"

// My Solution:

function remove(str, what) {
  //code me

  for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(what)) {
    while (value > 0) {
      str = str.replace(key, "");
      value--;
    }
  }

  return str;
}
